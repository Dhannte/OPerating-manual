This Charter outlines the structure and responsibilities of the Developer Advisory Board and its participants. It is authored and maintained by the Optimism Developer Advisory Board. 

This is the Season 6 Charter, which supersedes and replaces the Charters of all previous Seasons.

# Season 6 Devloper Advisory Board Charter v0.1

---

## Goals

1. Support the Optimism community through important technical decisions.
2. Support the Grants Council on evaluation technical Mission Requests.
3. Bring an additional technical perspective to thinking about the vision of the OP ecosystem and what needs to happen to get there.

## Participants

### Cohorts and Election Terms

- Members may be appointed by the Foundation for an initial term, but are subject to election thereafter.
- After the initial term, all members of the Developer Advisory Board will be elected at the start of a new term. Elected members serve for the duration of their term and must be re-elected to serve in future Seasons.
- Representatives should only serve in one elected position per term. There are no term limits for representatives, but they may be implemented in the future if the need arises.

## Responsibilities

### Members

- **Upgrade Czar (1)**
    - This role did not exist last season.
    - Specifically, the Upgrade Czar is responsible for:
        - (a) understanding the OP Stack deeply and reviewing all upgrades,
        - (b) leading the DAB in discussing and approving these upgrades, as one of four required delegate approvals, and
        - (c) writing up non-technical summaries of the changes for the community
        - (d) being available for consultation by delegates regarding important technical decisions, especially protocol upgrades
- **Ops Lead (1)**
    - This role did not exist last season.
    - Specifically, the Ops Lead is responsible for ensuring that all DAB tasks are well orchestrated and happen on time, including:
        - (a) improving the IOPs,
        - (b) scheduling meetings,
        - (c) interfacing with other Councils,
        - (d) organizing spreadsheets for feedback, and
        - (e) looking for any other opportunities to make changes that will keep the DAB’s efforts focused and effective
- **Reviewers**
    - This role did exist last season.
    - At least one OP Labs representative must be a member.
    - Reviewers are responsible for:
        - (a) reviewing Mission Request drafts and providing guidance to the Grants Council, specifically focusing on their technical merits and whether the grant size is reasonable.
        - (b) reviewing applications for Mission Requests and providing guidance to the applicants as well as the Grants Council, specifically focusing on the team’s detailed plan and whether they seem to be capable of executing on the mission.
        - (c) reviewing work product delivered for milestones on existing grants to provide guidance on whether the milestones have been successfully achieved.
        - (d) using “veto power” to keep Grants Council technically grounded (ie. a unanimous “no” vote by the DAB on any of these topics will block the Grants Council from voting “yes”).
- Any member may:
    - (a) be available for discussions for any core OP devs to provide an outside voice on technical and security related decisions.
    - (b) support in finding technical talent to fill important roles at OP Labs.
    - (c) generate ideas for the [Builders Ideas](https://contribute.optimism.io/) list to spur community contributions.

### Lead Responsibilities

- All representative structures must have Leads. The Lead is always a non-voting/non-signing member, so they remain focused on procedure and operations and may be considered unbiased as they don’t participate in decision making.
- The Council Lead’s role is procedural, communicative, and ministerial. It has no ability to influence the substantive decisioning making by members or signing by key holders.
- The Lead may break a tie in the case that members cannot come to consensus or temporarily fill the role of a member who has resigned or been removed.
- Specifically, the Season 6 Developer Advisory Board Lead will be responsible for:
    - (a) leading all board meetings,
    - (b) interfacing with other areas in OP governance to ensure the DAB is supporting where possible,
    - (c) working with Upgrade Czar on approving protocol upgrades,
    - (d) providing feedback for DAB members on their performance,
    - (e) exercising decision-making authority in the event that the board cannot come to consensus, and
    - (f) writing & sharing the retrospective after Season 6 on changes to improve the DAB going forward.

### Resignation process

1. If a member wishes to resign before the end of their term, they must appoint a replacement and communicate this change to the Lead at least 7 days prior to this change taking effect.
2. The Lead will then adjust quorum as needed and communicated the change through the structure’s Communication Thread.

### Accountability

- All Developer Advisory Board members are subject to Representative Removal as outlined in the Operating Manual. Removal votes will occur before the end of the next voting cycle. A contingent vote for their replacement on the Council will run in the same voting cycle. Please see [Representative Structure Framework](https://gov.optimism.io/t/collective-representative-structure-framework/5884) for additional details about edge cases related to removal.
    - All representatives may be removed from their position for failing to uphold the responsibilities outlined in the relevant Charter or for failing to act with honesty, integrity, and transparency. If there is a vote to remove a representative, the Lead, or a simple majority of the remaining membership, may appoint a replacement for the remainder of the term.
- The Developer Advisory Board will conduct a retrospective at the end of term which will be posted to the forum by the last day of the term.
- While persistent structures will be assumed to be renewed each Season, delegates may submit Dissolution Proposals if they believe a persistent structure is no longer fulfilling its mandate and should be discontinued.

### Budget

The approved operating budget for Season 6 Developer Advisory Board can be referenced [here](https://gov.optimism.io/t/zach-obront-developer-advisory-board-operating-budget/8141#breakdown-of-board-operating-budget-3).

### Iteration

The canonical version of Charters for persistent structures will be published to GitHub. Any material updates to the Charter will be reflected with a new version number at the top of this document, at which point the updated version will go into effect. 

This Charter must seek governance approval for changes to the mandate, scope, or budget approved by Optimism Governance. 

It should finally be reiterated that the role of all structures are intended to be progressively and programmatically reduced over time, as its functionalities are no longer needed or can be effectively managed by other means. Ultimately, it is the goal of the Collective to reach a state of protocol and governance reliability that allows for the full and final dissolution of any non-essential structures.
