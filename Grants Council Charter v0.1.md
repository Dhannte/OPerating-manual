I'm adding my draft of the S7 GC charter to the forum to get feedback from the Collective. S7 Budget TBD

This Charter outlines the structure and responsibilities of the Grants Council and its participants. It is authored and maintained by the Optimism Grants Council.

This is the Season 7 Charter, which supersedes and replaces the Charters of all previous Seasons.

### Goals

The Grants Council will allocate funds from the Governance Fund to support projects that drive measurable progress in the following success metrics for the Superchain:

* Support projects that drive measurable growth in the following metrics for the Superchain:
  * Increase Total Value Locked (TVL) denominated in ETH.
  * Increase Stablecoin TVL across the Superchain.
  * Increase Wrapped Asset TVL across the Superchain.
  * Increase Bridged Asset TVL across the Superchain.
* Create a streamlined and consistent process for grant applicants.
* Empower high-context delegates to make high-context grant decisions.
* Reduce the workload of non-Council delegates to enable their focus on high-impact votes.
* Coordinate with the Developer Advisory Board (DAB) and the Milestones and Metrics Council (MaM):
  * Ensure seamless information sharing to enable the DAB’s audit reviews and the MaM’s grant delivery operations.

Non-Goals:

* Retroactive funding (managed by a separate team).
* Programs that do not align with Superchain TVL metrics.

### Structure

### Normal Circumstances

* All grants must comply with [Collective Grant Policies](https://gov.optimism.io/t/collective-grant-policies/5833), including milestones, no-sale rules, and token lock-ups.
* The Council will review applications and allocate funds through a two-phase review system:
  1. GrantNerds: Conducted by generalist reviewers to assess eligibility, alignment and guidance to applicants.
  2. Final Review: Conducted by professional DeFi reviewers to evaluate TVL-driving potential.

### Participants

#### Cohorts and Election Terms

* Members are elected by the Token House at the start of the Season, with the exception of the Lead and Operations Specialist, who are elected when the Grants Council Budget is approved.
* Elected members serve for one term and may seek re-election for future terms.
* There are no term limits, but eligibility criteria for members must be met.

#### Key Roles

1. Lead (1 Member) responsibilities:
    * Publicly represents the Grants Council in forums and governance discussions.
    * Oversees procedural and operational alignment.
    * Prepares cycle reports and the End-of-Season Report.
    * Breaks ties in case of deadlocked votes.
    * Ensures rubrics and selection criteria are published at the start of the season.

2. Operations Specialist (1 Member) responsibilities:
    * Manages intake processes, tool coordination, and proposal tracking.
    * Ensures smooth execution of logistics.

    2. Final Reviewers (4 Members):
       * Deep-dive into proposals’ DeFi and TVL growth potential.
       * Finalize rankings for grant allocations.

All Council members will be required to disclose all anticipated conflicts of interest when applying to serve on the Council and all actual conflicts of interest if engaged in a vote affected by the conflict. Where a conflict is known to be present, a reviewer should recuse themselves or provide a written voting rationale if the reviewer believes that they can vote impartially.

4. Conflict of Interest Disclosure:

### Final reviewer eligibility

Participants of the Grants Council must meet the following criteria to ensure competence and alignment with the Council’s focus on driving TVL growth:

1. Competency: Advanced expertise in DeFi and financial systems, with a deep understanding of Total Value Locked (TVL) metrics. Reviewers must meet all of the following characteristics:

   * Demonstrate in-depth knowledge of liquidity provision, staking, lending, and tokenomics with a focus on TVL-impacting protocols.
   * Show a track record of evaluating or consulting for blockchain projects with significant TVL contributions.
   * Be familiar with Optimism and cross-chain TVL dynamics in the Superchain ecosystem.
   * Possess hands-on experience in a respected DeFi protocol development or management.

2. Reputation:

3. Conflict of Interest Disclosure:

   * Participants must disclose any potential conflicts of interest when applying and must recuse themselves from decisions where a conflict exists.

4. Commitment:

   * Participants must be able to dedicate the time and focus required to perform rigorous reviews, validate milestones, and actively contribute to discussions and voting processes.

### Resignation process

1. If a member wishes to resign before the end of their term, it must communicate this change to the Lead at least 7 days prior to this change taking [effect](http://effect.in/).
2. The Lead or Grants Council members must appoint a replacement by majority vote.
3. The Lead will then adjust quorum thresholds as needed and communicate the change through the structure’s Communication Thread.

### Accountability

Grants Council members are subject to the following checks and standards to ensure transparency, integrity, and alignment with their responsibilities:

1. Representative Removal:

   * Grants Council members may be removed for failing to uphold the responsibilities outlined in this Charter or for failing to act with honesty, integrity, and transparency.
   * Removal votes will occur before the end of the next voting cycle, as outlined in the Operating Manual.

2. Re-Election:

   * All Grants Council members must stand for re-election at the start of each new Season if they wish to continue serving.

3. Transparency and Oversight:

   * The Grants Council is required to operate transparently, enabling non-Council Token Holders to oversee its operations effectively.
   * Public reports will be issued after each review cycle and at the end of the Season to detail decisions and outcomes.

4. Retrospective Review:

   * At the end of Season 7, the Grants Council will conduct a retrospective to evaluate its performance and ensure continuous improvement. The retrospective will be posted publicly for community feedback.

5. Temporary Replacements:

   * In the event of a resignation or removal, the Lead or a majority of the remaining members may appoint a temporary replacement for the remainder of the term.

### Iteration

1. Canonical Version:

   * The approved version of this Charter will be published to GitHub and will serve as the authoritative document for the Grants Council’s operations during Season 7.

2. Material Updates:

   * Any material changes to the scope, structure, responsibilities, or budget of the Grants Council must receive governance approval. Changes will be reflected with a new version number in the published Charter.

3. End-of-Season Retrospective:

   * The Grants Council will conduct a retrospective review at the end of Season 7 to evaluate its performance, gather community feedback, and propose potential improvements for future terms.

4. Reduction Over Time:

   * The role of the Grants Council, as with all structures, is intended to be progressively reduced over time as its functions are automated or absorbed by other mechanisms. The long-term goal is to support a governance model that can operate without the Grants Council when it is no longer essential.
